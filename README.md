# QnA over Structured Data using Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to the **QnA over Structured Data** project repository! This project aims to demonstrate the creation of a Question-and-Answer (QnA) system using Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured data sources such as databases and CSV files. The power of LLMs lies in their proficiency in understanding and processing various types of data, making them an excellent tool for extracting valuable insights from structured datasets.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build a QnA system that allows users to ask questions related to the contents of structured data documents. By leveraging LLMs, we can transform raw queries into meaningful interactions with the data, enabling users to retrieve relevant information in a natural language format.

## Use Case

Consider a scenario where you have a structured dataset in the form of a database or a CSV file. You want to enable users to ask questions about the data within these documents without writing complex queries or having deep technical knowledge. This is where the QnA system comes into play. Users can input questions in plain English, and the system, powered by LLMs, will interpret and process these questions to provide accurate and contextual answers based on the underlying data.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the QnA system on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local environment using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dwiknrd/llm_qna.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

make sure, use `python=3.10`


3. **Running the QnA System notebook:** Execute the QnA system jupyter notebook
